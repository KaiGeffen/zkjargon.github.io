# Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proof (PIOP)

> An interactive proof system in which the prover computes polynomials and the verifier can query these polynomials at evaluation points of her choice.

---

Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proofs (PIOP, polyIOP or polynomial IOP) emerged from the development of SNARKs and were later formally defined in the DARK paper [[BFS20]](https://ia.cr/2019/1229). These are interactive protocols between a prover and a verifier. With each message the prover produces an oracle and the verifier gets to query any oracles it has received from the prover. In a PIOP, the prover can only produce oracles that evaluate polynomials with degree lower than a given bound.

The following figure is taken from *zk-SNARKs: A Gentle Introduction* [[Nit20]](https://www.di.ens.fr/~nitulesc/files/Survey-SNARKs.pdf)[^1] and illustrates the prover-verifier interaction in a PIOP:

>**AHP or Polynomial IOP?**
>Algrebraic holographic proofs and polynomial interactive oracle proofs are almost equivalent notions. They were developed concurrently in 2019 by separate research groups: the former by the group behind Marlin [[CHMMVW20]](https://ia.cr/2019/1047) and the latter by the group behind DARK [[BFS20]](https://ia.cr/2019/1229). While they formalise very similar proof systems, polynomial IOPs are more general in that they do not require *holography* (as defined in the [AHP article](./algebraic_holographic_proof.md)).
